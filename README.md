**Summary:**

Implemented the ApptBook ADT using a binary search tree (BST) data structure in Java, focusing on efficiency and maintaining a balanced tree. The implementation allows for efficient insertion, lookup, and iteration over elements.

**Key Achievements:**

Utilized a BST to achieve efficient insertion, lookup, and iteration operations.

Implemented handling of duplicates, ensuring that duplicate elements are placed in the right subtree.

Implemented cursor functionality for iterating over elements, handling cases where the cursor node has a non-null right child or a null right child.

Utilized private recursive helper methods for various operations, such as checking the height of the tree, counting nodes, and checking element placements.

Designed helper methods for clone, insertAll, and optional insert operations, using pre-order traversal for clone and a traversal method for insertAll.

**Challenges Overcome:**

Managing cursor movement and ensuring correct placement of elements in the tree during iteration posed challenges, which were addressed through careful implementation and testing.

Ensuring the BST remained balanced without explicit re-balancing techniques, relying on the efficiency tests to construct a balanced tree.

**Next Steps:**

Test the implementation rigorously using provided test suites, including internal tests for helper methods, efficiency tests, and random testing to ensure correctness and efficiency.

Further optimize the implementation if necessary, focusing on improving performance and addressing any edge cases or potential issues identified during testing.

Continue to explore and deepen understanding of binary search trees and related data structures to enhance problem-solving skills and proficiency in algorithmic design.
